    "1_4_6_update_LHMLib" : "Updated LHMLib to latest nightly build",
    "1_4_6_statistics_recording" : "Feature: added recording of statistics to the file immediately after enabling this setting",
    "1_4_6_cpu_load_not_updates" : "Fixed: CPU load sometimes not updates after Windows sleep",
    "1_4_6_autostart_crushing" : "Fixed: if shutdown was unexpected than next autostart might crush",
    "1_4_6_min_max_reset" : "Fixed: min and max temps and TDP were not reset if stat collecting had been enabled",
    "1_4_6_incorrect_max_values" : "Potentially fixed: sometimes max values were incorrect",

    "1_4_5_debug" : "Feature: added logging to file «debug.txt» if app goes wrong. If you will encounter crushes, you can send me that file with short description of the problem and i will try to fix that ASAP.",
    "1_4_5_settings_not_apply" : "Fixed: CPU settings not applied in some cases.",
    "1_4_5_minimal_states" : "Fixed: minimal default CPU states in Windows — 5 and 80 percent on battery and on plug respectively — were higher than custom maximum state and it prevented decreasing CPU frequency.",
    "1_4_5_doubled_run" : "Fixed: double run was possible. ",
    "1_4_5_clear_buttons" : "Fixed: clear buttons for temp, TDP, and average values were broken during last vast refactoring and not working.",
    "1_4_5_cpu_settings_not_resetings" : "Fixed: Windows default settings for CPU does not apply when program was closed from tray.",
    "1_4_5_UI_updates" : "Fixed: on startup UI are updating though app was running as minimized to tray.",
    "1_4_5_change_defaults" : "Optimization: changed default values for backup interval, temps, TDP collect interval and CPU threshold to 15 min, 0.7 sec and 80 percent respectively. Affect only start without settings file.",
    "1_4_5_tray_icon_updates" : "Optimization: tray icon now updates only if current temp was change.",
    "1_4_5_legacy" : "Optimization: removed collection and updating 2 legacy's lists: «general_temps» and «general_TDP».",

    "1_4_4_crushes": "Fixed unexpected crushes when CPU mode was changed.",

    "1_4_3_notifications": "Feature: added update notification.",
    "1_4_3_admin_right_description": "Feature: added description to admin rights requirements.",
    "1_4_3_clear_icons": "Interface: changed «Clear» label to icons on statistics clear buttons.",
    "1_4_3_name_and_version_link": "Interface: changed name and version from plain text link to Github into settings windows.",
    "1_4_3_tray_localization": "Fixed: tray's items now localized too. Before were only «Закрыть» in any case. ",
    "1_4_3_closing_correctly": "Fixed: AveTemp closing correctly when main window is open.",
    "1_4_3_cpu_name": "Fixed: now CPU names with any length are showing correctly.",

    "1_4_2_autostart_delay": "Feature: added setting for adjust autostart delay.",
    "1_4_2_backup_interval": "Feature: added setting for adjust backup interval. So now there is option to set backup once in an hour so background consumption will be - about 0 all time except 1 second in hour.",

    "1_4_1_separated_cpu_method": "Feature: a separate method to get CPU load was made and now frequency switching and turbo depend on this method. The polling rate is 0.1 second, so turbo is activated MUCH faster. Also added a check for at least 2 turbo «ticks» — two consecutive loads above the threshold — and the second must be greater than the first to activate turbo. Also, the turbo will be activated if there are 3 consecutive «ticks» only above the threshold, regardless of the level of exceeding the threshold.",
    "1_4_1_settings_translation": "Feature: added instant translation for the settings window when you change the language.",
    "1_4_1_pause_before_autostart": "Feature: added a pause before autorun. This gives time for other programs from the autorun to load as quickly as possible without restrictions. The default pause is 3 seconds. If AveTemp was already in the autorun, to activate this feature you must disable and enable autorun from the settings with settings saved.",

    "1_3_2_issue_12": "Fixed: issue that statistics won't delete when it was disabled —",
    "1_3_2_optimization": "Optimizations: now the min, max and current temps and TDP saving like separated data, so now no need to calculate them all the time",
    "1_3_2_added_check": "Added check statistics file version",
    "1_3_2_refactoring": "Refactoring: workers were moved to separated file",
