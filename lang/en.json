  "at_1" : "Any modern processor has several performance modes, from power saving to maximum performance mode.",
  "at_2" : "Windows defaults to an aggressive performance mode that maximizes computer responsiveness and provides only benefits with sufficient cooling, but this is not always the case. For example, in compact PCs such as notebooks or nettops, this leads to high temperatures, constant noise from the cooling system, drying out of thermal paste, and the need for frequent maintenance and cleaning.",
  "at_3" : "This happens because in order to increase performance you need to increase the power of the processor, but doubling the power does not give you double the performance gain. For example, to run at 1GHz the Ryzen 4600H processor needs only 5 watts of power, but to run at 2GHz it needs 15 watts. At 4GHz it needs all of 45-50 watts. So it turns out that to work at 50% performance the processor needs 30% power, and 100% performance — all 100%.",
  "at_4" : "Physically, this phenomenon is explained by the change in resistance of the materials of the processor when the temperature changes and the need to increase the voltage to raise the frequency. That is, to make the processor run faster, we need to increase the voltage and supply more power to the processor, but the heat increases. With heating, the resistance of the materials of the crystal grows, the power drop increases, which means that for the next frequency increase we need to increase the voltage, adjusted for the additional heat dissipation.",

  "hdt_2" : "The problem of insufficient cooling is relevant only for desktop PCs, in laptops and nettops the cooling cannot be replaced. Choosing the right cooling system is easy enough if you know the parameters of the processor and motherboard, where this cooling will be installed.",
  "hdt_3" : "In the case of a processor it is sufficient to know its TDP (Thermal Design Power) - the heat pack. Usually this information can be found on the Intel or AMD website, in the specifications of the processor, just like the maximum operating temperature.",
  "hdt_4" : "For a motherboard you need to know its socket. This can be AM4, AM5, LGA 1700 and others.",
  "hdt_5" : "Usually these two parameters are enough to choose a new cooling system. The new system should firstly have a motherboard socket mount and secondly dissipate more TDP than the processor provides. Preferably with a reserve.",

  "hdt_6" : "The next potential problem with CPU overheating is the lack of profiling, which is especially true for laptops.",
  "hdt_7" : "Many people know that you have to dust the computer, but that's not the only thing you have to do. There is thermal paste between the CPU's heat distribution cover and the cooling system itself. It fills all the space between the CPU and the cooling system, displacing air. This is important because air is an extremely poor conductor of heat.",
  "hdt_8" : "After a few years, the thermal paste dries out and stops working - it needs to be changed.",
  "hdt_9" : "Remember, if you are not an expert and are not willing to take the risks, do not clean or change the thermal paste on your PC yourself! The same applies to replacing the cooling system.",
  "hdt_10" : "To do this work, you need to understand what you are doing. Also, laptops often use PCM (Phase Change Material) instead of thermal paste. This is a material that conducts heat very well, better than many thermal pastes, but is hard when cold. It's very easy to get confused with dried thermal paste, remove it, apply a new one, and see that the temperatures are worse!",

  "hdt_11" : "The last thing that can happen is that the processor is using Turbo mode too often. In short, it is a mode in which the processor can run faster, but it also gets hotter.",
  "hdt_12" : "This is good for heavy loads, such as games or rendering videos, increased responsiveness of the computer, but also increases heat and noise, in addition leads to the above described drying out of thermal paste, clogging cooling dust and, as a consequence, the need for frequent preventive maintenance.",
